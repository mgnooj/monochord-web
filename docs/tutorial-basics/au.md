# Audio Unit

Use your new creations in your favorite DAW.

## Installation

-

## Interface

The Monochord AU interface is nearly identical to the main application, with a slightly streamlined presentation.

Your Tuning Toolbar and Monochord are fixed in the top half of the AU window.

The Synth controls are contained in a scrolling window in the bottom half of the AU window. The Synth controls are still divided into Oscillator, Filter, Filter Mod, and Envelope sections, now presented vertically rather than horizonally to fit the AU window.

## Presets

The Monochord AU shares its database with the main Monochord application, meaning all of your saved Tunings and Synth patches are available in both applications.

The Monochord AU can also save presets in the DAW for saving and loading patches locally.

Note that there is currently no support for saving and loading Tuning presets at the DAW level. The Monochord will always load with its default Tuning (i.e. 12-TET) activated. Custom tunings should be loaded each time a project is opened.
