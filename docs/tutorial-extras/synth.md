# Synth

Dive into the Microton FM's flexible synthesis module.

## Overview: FM Synthesis

Like many FM-inspired synths, the Microton FM can be broken down into four parts:

    - Oscillator(s): The component that emits a sound wave.
    - Filter: The component that modifies the sound wave's audible signals.
    - Filter modifier: A component which optionally makes programmatic modifications to the Filter.
    - Amplitude envelope: A component which modifies a signal's amplitude, or volume.

## Filter

70's inspired low-pass filter. Cutoff (20 hz - 12000 hz) and resonance controls.

## Envelope

The Amplitude Envelope allows us to shape the amplification of each note.

## Keyboard interface

Selecting any of "Micro", "Piano", or "Strip" from the Interface menu will access the virtual Keyboard interface. This is an on-screen MIDI keyboard capable of triggering any of the notes from your current tuning. Each interface responds to the Element Styling of the currently loaded tuning.

The "Micro", or Microtonal, interface is highly customizable in its keyboard layout: see Styling for more information.

## Presets

The Synth module has its own Preset section, distinct from the Tuning presets. Save, delete, and load synth patches all require just a few clicks.

Synths can be saved at any time by pressing the "Save" button and entering a name for the patch. Note that saving a synth patch with the same name as an existing patch will result in the existing patch being overwritten.

To delete a synth patch, first load the patch from the patches menu, and then press Delete.

## Mono/Poly switch

Switch between modes with single voice and six independent voices.
