# Audio Unit

![Microton AU Interface](/img/au.png)

Use your new creations in your favorite DAW.

## Installation

The Microton FM AUv3 package will be installed along with the desktop version of Microton FM from the App Store. No additional installation steps are necessary.

## Interface

The Microton FM AU interface is nearly identical to the main application, with a slightly streamlined presentation.

Your Tuning Toolbar and Monochord are fixed in the top half of the AU window.

The Synth controls are contained in a scrolling window in the bottom half of the AU window. The Synth controls are still divided into Oscillator, Filter, Filter Mod, and Envelope sections, now presented vertically rather than horizonally to fit the AU window.

## Presets

The Microton FM AU shares its database with the main Microton FM application, meaning all of your saved Tunings and Synth patches are available in both applications.

The Microton FM AU can also save presets in the DAW for saving and loading patches locally.
