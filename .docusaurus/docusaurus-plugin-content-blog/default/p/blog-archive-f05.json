(Each element's frequency is exactly 100 cents from the previous element, using A4 = 400hz as a starting point.) When we click on each element on the monochord, we can see its properties in the Element Editor.\n\n<!--truncate-->\n\n![Element Editor](./element_editor.png)\n\nExperimenting with alternate standards is simple; we select the root element and input a different frequency. Here, as a tribute to Leonard Bernstein, we retune to A442:\n\n![A442](./a442.png)\n\nThe monochord updates all of the other elements (and, by extension, the MIDI map) using the new tuning standard.\n\nWhat if we want to do something weird, like C4 = 500hz? Retune the root to 500hz, and input 'C4' in the MIDI transpose field:\n\n![C500](./c500.png)\n\nWe can also modify the elements directly to create our own tuning systems. One way is to simply click/touch and element and drag across the monochord:\n\n![Element drag gif](./element_gif.gif)\n\nFor more precision we'll turn back to the Element Editor. First, let's load the Just 5-Limit Augmented 4 tuning. To transform this tuning into its closely related Just 5-Limit Diminished 5 intonation, we modify the ratio of the tritone to 45/32.\n\n![Aug to dim](./aug_to_dim.gif)\n\nFinally, we can use the tuning system to quickly generate tuning templates to experiment with by using the 'Generate Equaltone Tuning' option. Here, we generate a quarter-tone tuning:\n\n![Quarter-tone](./quartertone.gif)\n\nAnd another example, where we generate a 9-tone equal tone tuning, then remove the second and sixth elements, which is the basis for the Microton's preset version of the Javanese Pelog tuning:\n\n\\![Pelog](./pelog.gif)\n\nSimple to learn, endless potential. Microton gives you the tools to speak any musical language - or create your own."},{"id":"release-day","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/release-day","source":"@site/blog/2024-11-01-release-day/2024-11-01-release-day.md","title":"Microton and Microton FM available on the Apple App Store","description":"Microton and Microton FM are officially available for purchase for desktop and iOS!","date":"2024-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":0.11,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Euclidean Instruments","title":"Development team","url":"https://euclidean-instruments.com","imageURL":"img/littlelogo.png","key":"euclid"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"release-day","title":"Microton and Microton FM available on the Apple App Store","authors":["euclid"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"An Introduction to the Microton tuning system","permalink":"/blog/an-introduction-to-the-microton-tuning-system"},"nextItem":{"title":"Hello World!","permalink":"/blog/hello-world"}},"content":"Microton and Microton FM are officially available for purchase for desktop and iOS!\n\n[![Microton app store link](./appstore.png)](https://apple.co/3A1akCW)\n\n[![Microton FM app store link](./appstoreFM.png)](https://apple.co/3YKix8a)"},{"id":"hello-world","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/hello-world","source":"@site/blog/2024-10-15-first-blog-post.md","title":"Hello World!","description":"Microton launches October 2024!","date":"2024-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":0.085,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Euclidean Instruments","title":"Development team","url":"https://euclidean-instruments.com","imageURL":"img/littlelogo.png","key":"euclid"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"hello-world","title":"Hello World!","authors":["euclid"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Microton and Microton FM available on the Apple App Store","permalink":"/blog/release-day"}},"content":"Microton launches October 2024!\n\nWe'll be posting news, tutorials, videos, and other fun stuff here.
